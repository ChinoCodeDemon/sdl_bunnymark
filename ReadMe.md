# SDL Bunnymark
The same as my SFML Bunnymark project but instead of SFML it uses SDL.
I also decided to try out meson for the build process, maybe it will be adopted in future projects.

## Building the Project
You can build it with meson.
1. get newest version of the meson build tool
2. go into the build folder
3. run the `meson build` command.
4. go into ./build
5. run the `meson compile`
6. a file called sdl_bunnymark should be now in the build folder.
